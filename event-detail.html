<p>

The Hack Club - North Developer Community is a computer programming club at Lovely Professional University, Jalandhar, Punjab and is a chapter of the International Hack Club organization. We meet weekly on Saturday.
Our weekly meetings include a wide discussion on diverse computer science topics for our members to explore and learn. Members (including newbies and volunteers) work on projects and demo them at the ending hours. These topics include cyber security, web design, database management, Raspberry Pi computing, how to contribute to open-source projects, and many, many more! Members of THC-NDC not only get to learn about amazing CS topics, but they also get to compete against their peers, connect with companies, volunteer for the community, and showcase their awesome projects.
Agenda of this Workshop:
We initiate this club with a vision to support students and developers to learn, build and share together. Our Agenda for this workshop is very simple, precise and dogmatic, we’ve divided our workshops into chapters and it is our Chapter No. 1 (event name). In this our very first official event, we will love to share the things which are basics and are need to be known to every student developer. Team Collaboration in a project, tools & software used to achieve it, and the new emerging technologies, languages, and companies’ requirements are some of the many topics which we’re going to explore together with our participants.
</p><br>

<a href="event-detail.html"><h2 class="event_title">Workshop Detail:</h2></a>
<p>
We are hosting 2-3 workshops and activities over the course of our event for participants to take breaks from their academic studies and explore about some other associative topics, technologies, companies and their projects. We’ve planned multiple tracks, to make sure to select enough workshops to cover most of the topics in the full schedule!
</p>
<br>
<a href="event-detail.html"><h2 class="event_title">List of topics:</h2></a>

<p><b>GitHub: </b>How to Collaborate in team with GitHub. The GitHub platform is an incredibly powerful collaboration tool. Anyone can collaborate on projects using GitHub! In this workshop, participants will create an account, become familiar with the GitHub platform, and use a best practice collaboration workflow to add their hometown to a map of all Localhost participants!</p>
<p><b>GitKraken Glo:</b> Git is a powerful tool, but it can be tricky to get up and running and to memorize the commands on top of learning the workflow. GitKraken is a tool that provides an app for interacting with Git and streamlines the collaborative process. Learn how to branch, commit, make pull requests, and resolve merge conflicts in this collaborative, interactive workshop!
</p>
<p><b>Algorithms:</b> How to begin with Competitive Programming? What is Competitive Programming and How to Prepare for It? What sort of things are required to better up your CP? What platform to choose to practice?
</p>
<p><b>Python: </b>We’ll look forward to learn about strategies and techniques of artificial intelligence to solve business problems. After the fundamental topics will discussed we will go over how AI is impacting different industries as well as the various tools that are involved in the operations for developing efficient solutions. By the end of the program, you will have numerous strategies under your belt that can be used to improve the you performance.
